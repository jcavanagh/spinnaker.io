title:  "Swagger UI"
---

If you installed Spinnaker, and the API gateway [Gate](https://github.com/spinnaker/gate) is running and accessible (e.g., at [localhost:8084](http://localhost:8084)), navigate to `<gate_endpoint>/swagger-ui/index.html` in your browser to view the auto-generated Swagger UI.

Some of the other Spinnaker services, such as Clouddriver, Front50, and Rosco, have their own Swagger UIs. These are each accessible at `<service_endpoint>/swagger-ui/index.html`.
